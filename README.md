## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

To run this application, you'll need the following software installed on your machine:

- Node.js (version 12 or above)
- npm (Node Package Manager)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ridhoafwani/gg-midterm.git
```

2. Install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

### Adding .env File to the Project

> **Note**
> No worries! I got you covered! ðŸŒŸ You can totally skip this step! I've already included my .env file to make things super smooth for the grader. You won't need to bother setting up a new database. Just dive right in and enjoy exploring the wonders of my Atlas database! ðŸ˜ŽðŸš€

To manage environment variables and sensitive configuration settings in your project, you can make use of a `.env` file. This file allows you to store key-value pairs, where each pair represents an environment variable.

Follow the steps below to add a `.env` file to your project:

1. **Create a New File**: In the root directory of your project, create a new file named `.env`.

2. **Define Environment Variables**: Open the `.env` file using a text editor and define your environment variables in the following format:

   ```plaintext
   PORT = your_port_value
   DATABASE_URL= your_database_url_value
   ```

   Dont porget to provide their corresponding values.

   For example:

   ```plaintext
   PORT = 3000
   DATABASE_URL= "mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@<mongo_cloud_database_url>/?retryWrites=true&w=majority"
   ```

### Running the Application

To start the Express.js API, run the following command:

```bash
npm start
```

The API will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Usage

You can use tools like [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) or [cURL](https://curl.se/) to interact with the API endpoints. Refer to the [API Endpoints](#api-endpoints) section for more details.

## Database Structure

![Alt text](<readme_asset/database design.png>)

### Videos Collection

The `videos` collection represents a set of videos in your application. Each video document has the following properties:

- **`_id`**: The unique identifier for the video, automatically generated by MongoDB.
- **`title`**: A string representing the title of the video. It is a required field, ensuring that every video document has a title.
- **`url`**: A string containing the URL of the video. This field is also required, ensuring that each video document has a valid URL.
- **`thumbnail`**: A string representing the URL of the video's thumbnail. This field is required, ensuring each video has an associated thumbnail.

### Products Collection

The `products` collection represents products related to videos in your application. Each product document is associated with a specific video and has the following properties:

- **`_id`**: The unique identifier for the product, automatically generated by MongoDB.
- **`videoId`**: A reference to the corresponding video for this product. It is of type `mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId` and references the `videos` collection, ensuring the integrity of the relationship with videos.
- **`title`**: A string representing the title of the product. It is a required field, ensuring that every product document has a title.
- **`price`**: A number representing the price of the product. It is a required field, ensuring that each product document has a valid price.
- **`url`**: A string containing the URL of the product. This field is required, ensuring each product has an associated URL.

### Comments Collection

The `comments` collection represents comments made on videos in your application. Each comment document has the following properties:

- **`_id`**: The unique identifier for the comment, automatically generated by MongoDB.
- **`comment`**: A string representing the content of the comment. It is a required field, ensuring that every comment document has a comment text.
- **`username`**: A string representing the username of the commenter. It is a required field, ensuring that every comment document has a username associated with it.
- **`videoId`**: A reference to the corresponding video for this comment. It is of type `mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId` and references the `videos` collection, ensuring the integrity of the relationship with videos.
- **`timestamp`**: A date representing the timestamp of when the comment was made. It is a required field and defaults to the current date when not provided.

### Users Collection

The `users` collection represents users in your application. Each user document has the following properties:

- **`_id`**: The unique identifier for the user, automatically generated by MongoDB.
- **`name`**: A string representing the name of the user. It is a required field, ensuring that every user document has a name.
- **`email`**: A string representing the email address of the user. It is a unique field, ensuring that each user has a distinct email address.
- **`profilePictUrl`**: A string representing the URL of the user's profile picture, if available.

#### Please note:

- The collections have an `_id` field by default, provided by MongoDB.
- The collection names are explicitly defined when creating the Mongoose models (i.e., 'videos', 'products', 'comments', 'users').

#### Additionally:

- The `comments` collection isn't directly connected to the `users` collection. As per the project requirements, we should provide the name in the payload when making a comment. So, let's assume that they are not connected to each other.
- The `users` collection will come in handy for adding authentication in the next project
